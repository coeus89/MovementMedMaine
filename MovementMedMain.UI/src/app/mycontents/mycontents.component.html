We are now offering orthotics!
Dr. Chaloux has partnered with Dr. Wedemeyer, Pedorthist and Founder of Solelutions Lab, to provide quality and custom orthodics so you do not have to experience daily pain in your feet, ankles, and joints. Dr. Chaloux would perform an foot exam to determine your medical need. Based on the data collected during your exam, he would then order a custom orthotic, through Solelutions Lab, that is tailored specifically to your need and situation.
